The GO-Global Host includes a Support Request Wizard that gathers log files and information about the host that can be sent to technical support. Administrators can run the Support Request Wizard from the Cluster Manager by clicking Help | Support Request Wizard or via the Start menu by clicking Programs | GraphOn GO-Global 5 | Tools | Support Request Wizard.

The wizard prompts the administrator for a description of the problem, a time frame for when the problem happened, and the user or users that were affected. If the issue is associated with an existing support case, administrators can enter the Case Number. By default, the zipped report is placed on the user profile's desktop, but administrators can select an alternative destination via the wizard.

Administrators can upload the zipped file to the support ticket via the GO-Global support portal [http://www.graphon.com/customer-support/graphon-customer-support-portal](http://www.graphon.com/customer-support/graphon-customer-support-portal) or reply to an existing support email (support@graphon.com) with the attachment.
