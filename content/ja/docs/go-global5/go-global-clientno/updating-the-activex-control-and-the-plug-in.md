If GO-Global was deployed via a Web browser's Add-on manager, users should launch a Web browser to access a GO-Global Web server. The Web pages will install and update the Web clients as long as the user has sufficient rights to install browser add-ons. If the user does not have sufficient rights to install browser add-ons (for example, if the user is running Internet Explorer and is not an Administrator or Power User), the client should be installed using the GO-Global Client Setup Program.

Users who have installed the Plug-in with Mozilla Firefox can update the Plug-in via Firefox's Add-on manager.

### To update the Plug-in

1. In Firefox, select Tools | Add-ons
2. Click the **Find Updates** button.
3. Install the update.

When users running the ActiveX Control connect to a GO-Global Host with an updated client, the ActiveX Control will update automatically, if users have Power User rights.

>The Firefox Plug-in update feature does not work if you install the native Windows Client. It only works when the Web client has been installed via the Web browser page.
