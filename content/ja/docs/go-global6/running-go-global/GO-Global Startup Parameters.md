When printerconfig = "none" or -ac is followed by none, printers are not automatically configured. When printerconfig = "default" or -ac is followed by default, the default printer is configured automatically. This is the default setting.                                 |

|                | multimonitor             | When set to “true”, the session’s desktop will span all monitors. When set to “false”, applications will be confined to the primary monitor.  multimonitor = “true” by default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

|                | height                   | The height of the frame or embedded window. (600 by default.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|                | embed                    | When set to “true” applications run within the browser window.

|                | noscale                  | When noscale is set to "true" and the browser is resized, the resolution of the embedded GO-Global session will adjust accordingly, rather than scaling the displayed image on the client. (noscale = "false" by default.)                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|                | useApp                   | When useApp= “true”, the GO-Global Web App will try to launch the full GO-Global App. When useApp=“false”, the Web App will not try to launch the GO-Global App. (useApp=“true” by default.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|                | installApp               | When installApp=“true”, the user will be prompted to install the full GO-Global App, if it is not already installed. If installApp=“false”, the user will NOT be prompted to install the GO-Global App and no link to install it will be displayed. When installApp=“addLink”, the Get the App link will be added to the GO-Global Web App's toolbar if the full GO-Global App is not already installed.                           |
| -clientscale   | clientscale              | clientscale, followed by the percent scale factor, causes the GO-Global App on Windows to scale the applications running in the session relative to applications running locally on the client computer. For example, adding -clientscale 200 to the command-line will cause applications running in the GO-Global session to appear twice as large as applications running locally on the client computer.                        |
| -clientdpi     | ClientDPIScaling Enabled | -clientdpi 1 or ClientDPIScalingEnabled="true" enables the GO-Global App's DPI scaling feature. -clientdpi 0 or ClientDPIScalingEnabled="false" disables the feature. When these options are specified, they override the value of the ClientDPIScalingEnabled property in the HostProperties.xml file on the host.                                                                                                                |
| -cn            | computerName             | When -cn 1 or computerName=1, the Windows client sends the CLIENTNAME environment variable to the host rather than the actual computer name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -krm           | keyreportingmethod       | This option instructs the client to send either unicode or keycode values to the host based on character type. -krm 0 — The client sends alpha keys as unicode and numeric keys as unicode. -krm 1 — The client sends alpha keys as keycode and numeric keys as unicode. -krm 2 — The client sends alpha keys as unicode and numeric keys as keycode. -krm 3 — The client sends alpha keys as keycode and numeric keys as keycode. |
